# Why hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Tim Tong](https://tktong.github.io/)

I'm currently a full-stack software engineer at Google working on the Play Store. 

Previously I was a software engineer at Workday for nearly 6 years where I started on a backend-for-frontend team. I later moved into authentication & security products (account take over prevention) for 3 years. In my last 2 years, I led the Workday Assistant team and provided guidance in the greater Workspace Platform organization. Outside of my immediate team, I was one of three owners for the Workday microservice framework used by over 12 teams across 3 major organizations.
